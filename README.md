ðŸ“¦ Project: E-commerce Subscription Platform 

Tech stack: Ruby on Rails (API mode), Inertia.js, Vue.js, PostgreSQL 

ðŸ”§ Overview 

This is a work-in-progress e-commerce application built with Rails and Vue (via Inertia.js). It is designed to support recurring subscription plans, including customer management, plan customization, and an admin interface for managing operations. 

ðŸ§© Key Features (Current Stage) 

Admin Interface: Built-in admin model with custom controllers and routes. 

Role Delegation System: Currently working on a group-based permission system, where an admin can create teams and delegate responsibilities. 

Frontend: Uses Vue.js with Inertia.js to create a modern single-page application experience while keeping Rails as the backend. 

ðŸ’¡ What Makes This Project Interesting 

Focus on real-world business logic like recurring billing and team permissions. 

Mix of Rails conventions and modern frontend architecture (Inertia bridges backend/frontend without full API complexity). 

Project is structured to be scalable and maintainable, following MVC best practices and using service objects when appropriate. 

ðŸš§ Next Steps 

Implementing subscription logic and integration with a payment provider. 

Finishing team permission features. 

Adding automated tests and background jobs for subscription renewals and notifications.
